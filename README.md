# Project Karpacz

Project Karpacz is a work-in-progress web server written in Rust. It aims to be memory-safe, efficient, and highly customizable, making it a great choice for developers and administrators looking for a modern Rust-based server solution.

## Features (planned)

- **High performance**: Built with Rustâ€™s async capabilities for optimal speed.
- **Memory-safe**: Built with Rust, which is a programming language offering memory safety.
- **Extensibility**: Modular architecture for easy customization.
- **Secure**: Focus on robust security practices and safe concurrency.

## Components

Project Karpacz consists of multiple components:

- **`project-karpacz`**: The main web server.
- **`project-karpacz-common`**: A shared component used by `project-karpacz` and its modules.
- **`project-karpacz-passwd`**: A tool for generating user entries with hashed passwords, which can be copied into the web server's configuration file.
- **`project-karpacz-mod-example`**: A dynamically linked module that can be loaded by `project-karpacz` and responds with "Hello World!" for requests to the `/hello` URL.
